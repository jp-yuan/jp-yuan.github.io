            <p>Hello and thanks for checking out my website! 
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm an enthusiastic Software & Machine Learning Engineer, deeply immersed in the exciting world of tech. My experience spans across developing machine learning solutions, usability redesign, and full-stack development, with a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, C++, and Java. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Software Engineering at San Jose State University, building upon my B.Sc. in Statistics and Data Science from UC Santa Barbara. My passion lies in bridging the gap between complex data analysis and practical, user-centered solutions. 
                
                Collaboration is key in my approach, and I thrive in aligning diverse teams to push boundaries and achieve shared goals. If you're up for a conversation about the latest in tech, innovative solutions, or just a friendly chat, I'm all ears. Let's connect!</p>
